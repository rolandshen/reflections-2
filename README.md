reflections-2
=============
I was unaware that there would be a second reflection this week. I feel that our
class discussion in Thursday's section covered the main points that the course
should improve on. As far as communication between staff and student goes, I was
unsure whether we should submit anything if we did not do anything programming
related in class for the week. Again, not having a set assignment schedule can
be confusing but we went over this in class.

I still have not felt an "A-ha!" moment in this course but hopefully when the
class starts to pick up next Tuesday there will be more opportunities to learn
new material.

Again there was no new material this week and as such I wouldn't have done
anything different. I'm glad that the GSIs are hosting office hours from 9am-
noon on Friday so that everyone can be on the same page.
